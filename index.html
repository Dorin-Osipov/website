            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Dorin! I'm a software developer with 5 years of experience creating web and mobile applications.
                I've always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve complex problems, which is why
                I pursued a career in software development.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Skills:</dt>
                <dd>I'm proficient in a range of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Java. I've
                    also
                    worked with various frameworks like Django, React, and Spring Boot. In addition, I have experience
                    with
                    cloud technologies like AWS and GCP, and I'm familiar with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB.</dd>

                <dt>Experience:</dt>
                <dd>I started my career as a Junior Developer at XYZ Company, where I worked on developing web
                    applications
                    using React and Node.js. After 2 years, I was promoted to a Senior Developer role, where I led a
                    team of
                    4 developers and helped build a mobile app using React Native. I then moved to ABC Company as a
                    Backend
                    Developer, where I designed and implemented RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and MongoDB.</dd>

                <dt>Passion:</dt>
                <dd>I'm passionate about building software that solves real-world problems and makes people's lives
                    easier.
                    In my spare time, I contribute to open-source projects and build personal projects that help me
                    learn
                    new technologies. I'm also interested in exploring the intersection of software development and
                    artificial intelligence.</dd>

                <dt>Personality:</dt>
                <dd>Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, playing basketball, and reading science fiction novels. I'm a big
                    fan
                    of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I love to travel to new places.</dd>

                <dt>Goals:</dt>
                <dd>In the future, I hope to work on more complex projects that challenge me and help me grow as a
                    developer. I'm also interested in exploring the use of machine learning and natural language
                    processing
                    in software development. Ultimately, my goal is to become a technical lead or architect and
                    contribute
                    to the development of innovative and impactful software products.</dd>
